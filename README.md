# Demand_Forecasting_Bikeshare

The goal of this project is to 
1) understand what regression model is the best for predicting the total number
of bikes(denoted as variable cnt) rented in a particular hour and 
2) interpret the result of chosen model and
determine whether it is resonable to view the fitted parameters as causal effects 
3) provide guidance for
future studies of bikeshare use based on the form of model.
